Welcome .. this repo stores a collection of freely available demos and advanced demos for AWS (and in the future other cloud platforms)
These demos are avialable in two ways
- here in instruction & architecture diagram form for free
- as part of [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) courses - including theory lessons and guided videos.

The free versions here are fully functional, with instructions & architecture diagrams and are maintained by me.

All demos have a structure ...
- `01_LABSETUP` contains assets required for the DEMO
- `02_LABINSTRUCTIONS` contains text instructions and architecture diagrams

Video guided versions are available in my courses at https://learn.cantrill.io
