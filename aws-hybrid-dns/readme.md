# Advanced Demo - Hybrid Directory between AWS and Simulated On-Premises

In this advanced demo you will get the chance to experience how to integrate the DNS platforms of AWS and a linux based, simulated on-premises environment using Route53 inbound and outbound endpoints.

The demo consists of 4 stages, each implementing additional components of the architecture  

- Stage 1 - Provision and Verify  
- Stage 2 - Connectivity  
- Stage 3 - Inbound R53 Endpoint (Onprem => AWS) 
- Stage 4 - Outbound R53 Endpoint (AWS => Onprem)
